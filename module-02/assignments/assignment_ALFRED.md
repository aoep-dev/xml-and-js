# Module 2 - Assignment
# 1. ERRORS
- Line 11: The element name 'effectiveDate' was seperated by a space. It should be a single word or compound word seperated by some characters like '_', '-', or by capitalization of the first letter of the subsequent words in the phrase.

Correction: Removed the space between 'effective' and 'Date'

# 2. Use of CDATA
CDATA is used in place of character entities and references to allow for special characters to be used without conflict. The data within the block is seen as a string and cannot be parsed. This helps the string keep its format as it was originally enter in the CDATA block
